Designed an RTOS from scratch for a Cortex M4F Micro-controller that implements a select able cooperative or preemptive RTOS with support for semaphores, yielding, and system timers. Programmed common kernel functions such as yield, sleep in coordination with system tick timer, wait, and post. Programmed a prioritized kernel scheduler that schedules processes based on their state and priority. Performed different context switch routines by the kernel based on RTOS cooperation and preemption mode. Implemented an UART receive ISR that posts to a semaphore which is consumed by a worker thread.
